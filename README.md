### Initializing the application

To view that application functioning follow along the next steps:

- Make a clone of this repository;
- In the project root directory, install all **project dependencies** by typing this command line:

	```bash
	npm install
	```

	> To follow this step, [NodeJS with NPM](https://nodejs.org/) is required.

- The next step is to run the start command line:

	```bash
	npm start
	```

- After that, everything going well, the project can be accessed by a localhost port seen in the command line bellow:

  ```bash
	Server is running on port 3333.
  ```

- This means that a local server is running on the mentioned port;
- To use all resources from this API, use the following base URL:

	`http://localhost:3333`

- To make the requests, [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download) will be used;

### Using the resources

- #### **Users roles**

	#### :green_circle: **POST/ roles**  

	**Description:** Create a role 

		First of all, create useful roles for the establishment. For now, this API is handling tow personas: _administrator_ and _default user_. To create a role, send a request at URL:

		`http://localhost:3333/roles`

	**ATTENTION**:

	> Use "ROLE_'NEW-ROLE'" as a pattern for the roles.
	
	> "ROLE_USER" has to be the first one to receive id (identity/ id = 1), as this will be used later. 

	**Requests**

	```json
	{
		"role": "ROLE_USER",
		"description": "Usu√°rio padr√£o."
	}
	```

	```json

	**Description:** Create a user

	- "Administrator

		> Will manage and can access the hole API having both roles/ personas;

	- "User"
		
		> Will have restricted accesses and only one role/ persona ("ROLE_USER"), assigned to him as default;
	
	To achieve this, send the requests at URL bellow:

	`http://localhost:3333/users`

	**ATTENTION**:

	> As security, encrypt Administrator password, is advised, using the tool of your choice (MD5HASH was used here). Save it for security and future accesses.

	> All users created without "roles" sended within request will be assigned as _"default users"_.
